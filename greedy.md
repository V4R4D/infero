# Greedy Algorithm
Greedy algorithm is any algorithm that uses the approach of finding the locally optimal choice at each stage in problem solving.    
Greedy algorithm **does not** always result in the optimal solution, we shall see such an example in the later part of this blog.    
Let us take a look at few questions before moving on to the theory part.    
>You are given two numbers a and b ($\geq$ 0), your goal is to maximise the gcd(a,b), where gcd is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$. you can do the following operations on a and b. Consider $gcd(a,0)=a$   
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.) Increase both a and b by 1.    
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.)Decrease both a and b by 1.        
>Caution: After any operation a and b should still be non-negative    
> ### Input 
> Two Integers $a$ and $b$ ($\leq 10^9$)
> ### Output
> Print a single line containing two integers
