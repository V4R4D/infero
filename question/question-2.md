Suppose we had coins worth all possible values between $1$ and $10$, both inclusive. You want to buy biscuits, each packet costs $n$ rupees, but you have a very large of $10$ rupee coins but only one coin worth $r$ rupees $(1 \leq r \leq 9 )$, the shopkeeper doesn't have change either. So, you decide to buy the minimum number of packets $(\geq 1)$ such that you can pay for it precisely.
### Input
The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1\leq t \leq 100)$, the number of test cases. The second line contains two integers $n$ and $r$ $(1\leq n \leq 1000)$ respectively
### Output
You need to find the minimum number of packets $(\geq 1)$ that you can buy, such that you can pay for it precisely.
### Input
> 1
